# Challenge: Payment System

You will have to build a REST API (Python and Flask are the preferrable language and runtime environment, but you may build it as you wish) that will integrate two different payment services (like building a gateway that communicate with stripe and paypal).

## API requirements:
 - A route to create Clients;
 - A route to create Transactions;
 - A route to retrieve Clients;
 - A route to retrieve transactions. It shall allows filtering by clients or payment service used;
 - A transaction should be created in only one payment service (randomly choosed in each request);

 ## How will you be evaluated
- Is you API working?
- How did managed you remote repository?
- Which libs, frameworks, services and technologies did you choose to built the APP;
- How is the code coverage of the project?
- Did you guaranteed somehow you API reliability/uptimer?

## Expected
- Microservices;
- Python;

## Better if
- Docker;
- Flask;
- NoSQL;
- Karma commit;
